As an aspiring data analyst, I have created this repository to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL through a series of projects. Each project focuses on different analytical tasks, utilizing various SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights from datasets. This collection serves as a testament to my analytical capabilities and my ability to work with SQL databases effectively.

Dive in and explore the world of data analysis with me! ðŸŒŸ

## Project Overviews
