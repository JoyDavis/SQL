As an aspiring data analyst, I have created this repository to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL through a series of projects. Each project focuses on different analytical tasks, utilizing various SQL techniques to extract meaningful insights from datasets. This collection serves as a testament to my analytical capabilities and my ability to work with SQL databases effectively.

## Project Overviews
### [1. Superstore Analysis](https://github.com/JoyDavis/SQL/blob/main/Superstore%20Database) 🛒
   
Welcome to the Superstore Analysis project! This project dives into a fictional dataset from a superstore, providing insights into various aspects of the business, such as sales, inventory, pricing, and customer ratings. The primary goal is to utilize SQL queries to extract meaningful information that can help in making data-driven decisions.

#### Key Objectives:
- Stock Analysis: Determine which items have the lowest and highest stock in each category to manage inventory effectively.
- Pricing Insights: Identify the most and least expensive items in each category to understand the pricing strategy.
- Customer Ratings: Analyze customer ratings to highlight the best and worst-rated items, helping improve product offerings.
- Average Calculations: Calculate the average price and rating of items within each category to get an overall sense of product performance.
  
By exploring this dataset, I aim to uncover trends and patterns that can lead to better business strategies and improved customer satisfaction. 😃
