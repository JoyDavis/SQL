Welcome to the Superstore Analysis project! This project dives into a fictional dataset from a superstore, providing insights into various aspects of the business, such as sales, inventory, pricing, and customer ratings. The primary goal is to utilize SQL queries to extract meaningful information that can help in making data-driven decisions.
