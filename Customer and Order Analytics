--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

/*
This set of SQL queries retrieves various details from the 'customers', 'JanSales' and 'FebSales' tables:

1. Determines the total number of orders placed in January.
2. Identifies the number of iPhone orders placed in January.
3. Retrieves customer account numbers for orders placed in February.
4. Finds the cheapest product sold in January and its price.
5. Calculates the total revenue for each product sold in January.
6. Analyzes product sales and revenue at a specific location in February.
7. Identifies customers who ordered more than 2 products at a time and calculates the average amount spent.
8. Determines locations in New York that received at least 3 orders in January and counts the orders.
9. Calculates the number of each type of headphone sold in February.
10. Calculates the average amount spent per account in February.
11. Calculates the average quantity of products purchased per account in February.
12. Identifies the product that brought in the most revenue in January and its total revenue.
